    <h3>Description</h3>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 slices bacon</li>
        <li>3 cups shredded, cooked chicken breast meat</li>
        <li>½ small onion, chopped</li>
        <li>⅔ cup barbeque sauce</li>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) can refrigerated pizza crust dough</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; crumble.</li>
        <li>Add shredded chicken and onion to hot bacon grease in the pan. Cook and stir over medium heat until onion is tender. Stir in 1/3 cup barbeque sauce; remove from heat. Mix in crumbled bacon.</li>
        <li>Roll pizza crust dough onto a greased cookie sheet. Press out to an even thickness, then cut in half. Divide chicken mixture between dough pieces, spreading 
            over 1/2 of each dough piece to within 1/2 inch of the edge.</li>
        <li>Drizzle remaining barbeque sauce over the filling. Sprinkle with cheese and cilantro. Fold uncovered portion of dough over the filling. Press the edges together with a fork to seal.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned, about 25 minutes. Cool for a few minutes, then cut each calzone in half for 4 servings. Serve with additional barbeque sauce if desired.</li>
    </ol>
